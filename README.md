# About Me
Hi, welcome on my website. It is clearly still in progress. 

I am a first year PhD student at the departement of economics of the University of Leuven. My promotor is prof. Erwin Ooghe and I specialise in emperical labour economics with policy applications. I am currently working around minimum wages and unemployment benefits. I received a FWO scholarship for my PhD. 

I mainly code in Python but I also work with R, Matlab and Stata.
