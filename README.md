Hi, welcome on my website. It is clearly still in progress. Sorry about that. 

I am a first year PhD student at the departement of economics of the University of Leuven. My promotor is prof. Erwin Ooghe and I specialise in emperical labour economics. I am currently working around minimum wages and unemployment benefits. I mainly code in Python but I also work with R, Matlab and Stata.
