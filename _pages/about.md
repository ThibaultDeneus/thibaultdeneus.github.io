<div style="text-align: justify;">

Hi, welcome to my website. It is clearly still in progress.

I am a fourth-year PhD student at the Department of Economics of the University of Leuven. My promotor is Prof. Erwin Ooghe, and I specialize in empirical labour economics. I am currently working on topics including minimum wages, teacher time allocation, and the meaning of work. I received an FWO scholarship for my PhD.

I mainly code in Python and R, but I also work with Matlab and Stata.

  <div style="text-align: justify;">
  <p>Many people derive a sense of impact or purpose from their jobs â€“ they consider work to be a source of meaning. But how to make work meaningful? Theoretical models suggest that meaning can be created through social and non-social impact. We exploit rich panel data to empirically assess these models, and estimate a nonlinear production function for work meaning that allows for noisy and complementary inputs. We find that social impact is the most effective pathway to meaning, and estimate a direct output elasticity of about 0.55. We also find evidence of a negative interaction with non-social impact. A standard deviation increase in social impact is twice as effective in creating meaning for individuals that perceive their jobs as having little non-social impact, compared to those with high perceived non-social impact.</p></div>
