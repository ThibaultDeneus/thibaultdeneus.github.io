Hi, welcome on my website. It is clearly still in progress.

I am a fourth year PhD student at the Department of Economics of the University of Leuven. My promotor is Prof. Erwin Ooghe, and I specialize in empirical labour economics. I am currently working on topics including minimum wages, teacher time allocation, and the meaning of work. I received an FWO scholarship for my PhD.

I mainly code in Python and R, but I also work with Matlab and Stata.
